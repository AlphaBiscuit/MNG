  "description": "On days when she is sick, on days when she has a tedious day job, on days when she has regular tests.\n\nOn days when she is too lazy to go to school, I am called upon.\nI am a convenient substitute for the body of a girl named Sunao Aikawa, and that is me.\nI may look exactly the same, but my personality is a little different.\nI can't go out freely, I can't even make plans for tomorrow,\nI am a replica whose mission is to work for the original.\nI was supposed to be a replica, but I fell in love.\n\nA very pure and slightly mysterious \"love story\" that takes place in a town by the sea.",
