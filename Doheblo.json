  "description": "The manga is set in the near future, and begins with the awakening of police officer Kiku Shinonome, who was put into cryogenic stasis for 60 years to stave off what would have been a fatal wound. In a new world unfamiliar to her, she is forced to team up with Kyo Tsukisagari, a criminal with a big rap sheet but equipped with psychic powers. Together, they solve paranormal incidents, even while their personalities butt up against each other.",
